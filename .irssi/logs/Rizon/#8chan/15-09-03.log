22:11 AnimeWatche   I wish sega would make a console again
22:11        phut   penises are obscene unless they are jews because jews are animals and animal penises can be shown on tv

22:15  faggetttss   co1nie2 is a faggot
22:15     obscure   All the Germans in the tv show Hogan's Heroes are portrayed by jewish actors. Nice touch.
22:15      Durvin   then I got a NES in '86
22:15        exne   adventure, raiders of the lost ark, riddle of the sphinx, pitfall ii
22:15        exne   those are the 2600 games everyone should play
22:15      Durvin   no, atari 2600 games arent worth playing. theyre total shit
22:16      Durvin   some of them are engineering masterpieces. but theyre shit games

22:21        exne   you're just a bad person
22:22      Durvin   the only thing good about it was when you end up in the dragon's stomach and can see yourself inside of it
22:22     weakfat   Durvin, you can fuck the dragon's stomach?
22:22     obscure   weakfat, I read everything
22:22        exne   if you really knew this game you would have more to say about being in the dragon's stomach
22:23      Durvin   it was a maze game where you collected items to go to the next segment
22:23      Durvin   thats it
22:23        exne   there was no next segment
22:23      Durvin   yeah the colors would change and you'd be in a new maze

22:23     weakfat   obscure, will you describe the best way for a white woman to prepare herself if she knows a white man is going to rape her for a week?
22:23 shadow_chas   i was able to grab the sword outside of the dragon and kill it after being eaten
22:24 shadow_chas   adventure had a couple of easter eggs too iirc
22:24        exne   there are three castles, each with a key, and you use different items like a magnet or bridge to get the keys, then a bag comes and takes your sword and leaves a dragon in its place

22:25      Durvin   well fuck, it had a magnet and a dragon bag. remake this now
22:25     obscure   weakfat, I don't see why there should be any special preparation required since the vaginal orifice is self lubricating and evolved to accept the male organ naturally. She should of course eat well and stay hydrated.
22:25        exne   * a bat
22:25 AnimeWatche   I'll be back later.... hopefully

22:28     weakfat   Durvin, lol
22:28        exne   well anyway what you do is kill the dragons, use the bat to move them around, hide them in nasty places, then lock the bat in the home castle and then hide the rest of the items
