### dotfiles
dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine

If you want to give these dotfiles a try make sure you read the code
over, things will go much smoothly that way, and even modify if you 
need to.

### Installation
You can clone the repository wherever you want, but to install, add 
the files to your ~/ (/home/$USER/). 

'''bash
git clone https://github.com/rlingam/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles && cp ~/.dotfiles/* ~/
'''
